Flex-Dump: A Header Conversion Tool for Flex 3

Flex-Dump is a Python tool designed to convert class-dumped headers from iOS frameworks into a format suitable for Flex 3 patches. By automating the conversion process, it simplifies the creation and modification of Flex 3 patches for developers and enthusiasts.

How to Use the Script

Step 1: Dump Headers Using class-dumpc
	1.	Download class-dumpc from this release.
	2.	Open a terminal and run the following command:

./class-dumpc -H <drag in the framework binary> -o <output directory>

Example:

./class-dumpc -H /path/to/GoogleInteractiveMediaAds.framework/GoogleInteractiveMediaAds -o /path/to/output/GoogleInteractiveMediaAds.framework

	‚Ä¢	Ensure the output directory has the same name as the framework, e.g., GoogleInteractiveMediaAds.framework.
	‚Ä¢	All headers should now be dumped into the specified directory.

Step 2: Run the Flex-Dump Script
	1.	Run the script using Python 3:

python3 convert_headers_to_extracted.py


	2.	When prompted, enter the name of the framework (without the .framework extension). For example:

GoogleInteractiveMediaAds  


	3.	Drag the entire framework folder (e.g., GoogleInteractiveMediaAds.framework, which contains all the headers) into the script when prompted.
	4.	The script will generate a .extracted file named after the framework.

Step 3: Copy the Extracted File to Flex 3 Directory
	1.	Move the generated .extracted file to:

/var/mobile/Documents/Flex  


	2.	Open Flex 3, and the new library should appear under the ‚ÄúEmbedded Libraries‚Äù section.
